## 2. Description of Service

Mybucks.online is a browser-based, password-only, and self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet. The Service generates a private key from your password and passcode inputs using an industry-standard, verified one-way hash function (scrypt Key Derivation Function and keccak256). Your private key forms your account, allowing you to transfer, receive, and hold your crypto assets.

### Key Features:
- **Self-Custodial**: You maintain full control and custody of your private keys
- **Browser-Based**: The Service fully runs on your browser side without using any storage or invoking any third-party APIs for key management
- **No Storage**: Your private key is instantly generated from your password input, and whenever you close or refresh your browser, there is no footprint
